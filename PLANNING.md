Why this works

schedule gives you the gamePk for a team on a date; you don’t need the monster hydrate string you pasted unless you want extras. 
xStats

v1.1/game/{gamePk}/feed/live is the unified GUMBO feed with liveData.plays.allPlays, currentPlay, and linescore. Polling it with If-None-Match avoids duplicate payloads.
