Why this works

schedule gives you the gamePk for a team on a date; you don’t need the monster hydrate string you pasted unless you want extras. 
xStats

v1.1/game/{gamePk}/feed/live is the unified GUMBO feed with liveData.plays.allPlays, currentPlay, and linescore. Polling it with If-None-Match avoids duplicate payloads.

Next tweaks

Add a --team LAD --opponent BAL disambiguator for doubleheaders

Squash noise: only print scoring plays unless --verbose

Cache team id map locally to skip the tiny /teams call

If you want this wrapped as a pip-installable CLI with an entry point, say the word and I’ll cut it into a package layout with uv support.
